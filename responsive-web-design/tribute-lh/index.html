        Often regarded as one of the greatest rappers of all time, as well as
        being a pioneer in the Neo soul genre, Hill is widely credited for
        breaking barriers for female rappers, popularizing melodic rapping and
        for bringing hip hop to popular music. She is known for being a member
        of Fugees and her solo album The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, which won
        many awards, and became one of the best-selling albums of all-time. Hill
